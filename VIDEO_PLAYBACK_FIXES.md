# Video Playback Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Access Denied Popup Showing Immediately
**Problem**: The access denied modal was showing immediately when the video loaded, instead of when the user reached the end time.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the access check logic in `VideoPlayer.tsx` to allow videos to play their free portion first
- Changed `setCanPlayVideo(true)` for paid videos so they can play the free range
- Removed the immediate `setShowPaidMessage(true)` call

### 2. Video Not Playing from Start to End Time
**Problem**: Videos with start/end times were getting frozen and not playing smoothly.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the initial seek logic in `VideoProgressBar.tsx`
- Removed complex async/await patterns that were causing timing issues
- Made the initial seek more direct and reliable
- Added proper callback mechanism (`onInitialSeekComplete`) to coordinate between components

### 3. Video Not Restarting from Start Time When Scrolling
**Problem**: When scrolling down and back up to the same video, it wasn't restarting from the designated start time.

**Solution**:
- Added logic in `VideoPlayer.tsx` to reset video to start time when becoming active
- Reset modal states when video becomes inactive/active
- Ensured proper cleanup of seek states when switching videos

## Key Changes Made

### VideoPlayer.tsx
1. **Access Check Logic**: Allow paid videos to play free portion initially
2. **Video Reset on Active**: Reset video to start time when becoming active again
3. **Removed Unused Variables**: Cleaned up `shouldAutoPlay` variable
4. **Simplified Player Creation**: Removed complex conditional logic in player setup

### VideoProgressBar.tsx
1. **Fixed Status Listener**: Changed from `status.isLoaded` to `status.status === "readyToPlay"`
2. **Simplified Initial Seek**: Removed complex async patterns, made seek more direct
3. **Better Modal Handling**: Improved access modal text and behavior
4. **Fixed TypeScript Issues**: 
   - Changed timeout type from `NodeJS.Timeout` to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`
   - Fixed unused parameter warnings
   - Removed unnecessary `await` keywords
5. **Enhanced Modal Reset**: Reset both `hasShownAccessModal` and `modalDismissed` when video becomes inactive
6. **Improved Modal Close**: When closing modal without purchase, seek back to start time

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Free Videos**: Play normally from start to finish
2. **Paid Videos with Free Range**: 
   - Play from `start_time` to `display_till_time`
   - Show access modal when reaching end time (not immediately)
   - Allow seeking within free range
   - Restrict seeking outside free range with helpful messages
3. **Video Scrolling**: 
   - When scrolling back to a video, it restarts from the designated start time
   - Modal states are properly reset
4. **Access Modal**: 
   - Shows user-friendly message about premium content
   - Provides clear action button
   - Handles both purchased and non-purchased scenarios

## Technical Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error catching and logging
2. **Performance**: Simplified logic reduces unnecessary re-renders
3. **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript warnings and errors
4. **Code Clarity**: Removed complex async patterns that were hard to debug
5. **State Management**: Better coordination between VideoPlayer and VideoProgressBar components

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with videos that have `start_time` and `display_till_time` set
2. Test scrolling behavior (down and back up to same video)
3. Test seeking within and outside allowed ranges
4. Test access modal appearance timing
5. Test both free and paid video scenarios
6. Test video switching and state cleanup
